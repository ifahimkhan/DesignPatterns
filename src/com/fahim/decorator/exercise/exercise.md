Exercise
We’re going to build a code editor like IntelliJ or VSCode. When we open a
project, we should see all the artefacts (items) in that project.
Every artefact should have an icon and the icon can be different from one
artefact to another. For example, the Main file’s icon has a special green play
marker on top of the icon.
Similarly, if an artefact includes errors, its icon should include an error marker:
Run the code in the Demo class. We’re simulating the rendering of these
icons using simple strings.
Next, look at the current implementation of these concepts in the decorator
package.
Read my comments in the Artefact class about the problems with this
implementation.
Refactor the solution using the decorator pattern.
